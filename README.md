Project Topic:  Walls and Warriors Game
This is a brief description of Walls & Warriors game. Original Walls & Warriors is a brain-testing board game, which includes a game board, 5 puzzle pieces, 7 warriors and a level booklet. Players start the game with placing the Warriors into the specified points on the level map. After that, players need to place the walls on the game board. Walls must be placed on the game board in such a way that, they will cover all the blue warriors inside the walls and leave the red Warriors out of the walls.

Description below is a brief explanation of our game Lords in Halls built upon the vanilla board game Walls and Warriors. Basically the differences between our version and the vanilla version are listed below. 

Firstly, we plan to define different solutions for each challenge. Every challenge has some (maybe only one) good and some (maybe only one) bad solutions. When we say bad, we do not mean that it is not a solution. It is indeed a solution as well, but under certain circumstances, other solutions might be considered as “better”. Easy as it looks.

Introduction of the White Knight : Our expansion introduces a totally new piece into the game: a white knight. If a challenge includes the white knight, players try to get it into the borders of the fortress as well. If done, players get extra points from the challenge, which makes the solution a better one, as mentioned above. Worth to mention, the vanilla version tells us that every challenge has only one solution, thus the position of such a piece will not change anything. We will change the maps and position of the pieces accordingly so that, there will be more than one solution where the position of the white knight matters. 

Time Challenges: Test your visual intelligence in a given time! Providing a new game mode with the challenges that players are expected to solve in a given time, makes the game more challenging. Give it your best shot and see how far you can go through the challenges. 

Requirements: We need an algorithm that creates different solutions (bad or good) for a given challenge. Such algorithm is needed to create challenges that have different difficulty levels. We plan to implement this algorithm to boost the difficulty and variety of the game levels. Also we need some new challenges. Those challenges have to be different from the original games' challenges since those have only one solution which is inappropriate for our game. We need more than one solutions with the introduction of the white knight in many levels. We might also implement another algorithm which creates random maps but we might also create those maps manually for the sake of facility. 

For further improvement, we might consider making harder challenges with bigger maps and extra pieces (more knights and more wall pieces). 

We might also add a complex map script which creates new and totally random maps with certain difficulties. This would also creates new ideas about new game modes.
