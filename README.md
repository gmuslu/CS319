Description
This is a brief description of our game Walls & Warriors built upon the vanilla board game. Basically the differences between our version and the vanilla version are listed below. 

Firstly, we plan to define different solutions for each challenge. Every challenge has some (maybe only one) good and some (maybe only one) bad solutions. When we say bad, we do not mean that it is not a solution. It is indeed a solution as well, but under certain circumstances, other solutions might be considered as “better”. Easy as it looks.

Introduction of the White Knight : Our expansion introduces a totally new piece into the game: a white knight. If a challenge includes the white knight, players try to get it into the borders of the fortress as well. If done, players get extra points from the challenge, which makes the solution a better one, as mentioned above. Worth to mention, the vanilla version tells us that every challenge has only one solution, thus the position of such a piece will not change anything. We will change the maps and position of the pieces accordingly so that, there will be more than one solution where the position of the white knight matters. 

Time Challenges: Test your visual intelligence in a given time! Providing a new game mode with the challenges that players are expected to solve in a given time, makes the game more challenging. Give it your best shot and see how far you can go through the challenges. 

For further improvement, we might consider making harder challenges with bigger maps and extra pieces (more knights and more wall pieces). 

We might also add a complex map script which creates new and totally random maps with certain difficulties. This would also creates new ideas about new game modes.
